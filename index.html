      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
      <p>Mesage recieved, what is the current location and altitude of this aircraft</p>
   </body>
   <div>
    <p>Pilot, you are currently flying over Antarctica, and the penguins are not happy about it. Current altitude 25,000ft.</p>
    <p> Copy that, what are the conditions up ahead, should we expect any turbulence? Should we make changes to the current route?</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p>Pilot, skies are clear but blizzards expected at lower altitudes in an hour. We suggest the following actions be taken:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Disengage Autopilot.</li>
        <li>Increase altitude to 45,000ft.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye out for projectile. The penguins have attained aircraft targeting missiles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Copy that. The penguins seem to have gone into full on war mode! We may need some backup for protection. I have attached an image of the current situation</p>
